Shrikhand Gujarati + Latin | Google Web Fonts Development

A big, bold, and unapologetic display type that evolved from discussions with
colleagues about how good the Gujarati script looks when it's free to be as
curvatious and expressive as possible. A sort of Gujarati Cooper Bold. Along
with standardised Indic programming I would like to include some stylised

<p>For the last three of four years I have lived in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, working for Indian Type Foundry. During this time India has had a profound effect on my design and world-view. Shrikhand is the culmination of three years absorbing the colourful and vibrant hand-painted lettering that can be seen on the streets of Gujarat. Big, bold, and unapologetic, Shrikhand is a display type that evolved from discussions with colleagues about how good the Gujarati script looks when it's free to be as curvatious and expressive as possible. A sort of Gujarati Cooper Bold. Shrikhand is the name of a sweet and creamy Gujarati dessert that is a particular favourite of mine.

Commissioned by Google Fonts in June 2015, Shrikhand is fully support both the Gujarati and Latin writing systems and is freely available under a open source license. All development work, and the project as a whole, is accessible on GitHub, here.

As with all of my type design projects Shrikhand will be fully Unicode compliant and supported by opentype technology.</p>=======
