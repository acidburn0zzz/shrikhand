Shrikhand Gujarati + Latin | Google Web Fonts Development

A big, bold, and unapologetic display type that evolved from discussions with
colleagues about how good the Gujarati script looks when it's free to be as
curvatious and expressive as possible. A sort of Gujarati Cooper Bold. Along
with standardised Indic programming I would like to include some stylised
contextual alternates to add flair and spontaneity.
