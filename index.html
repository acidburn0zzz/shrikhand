  <h1>Shrikhand</h1>
  <p>Shrikhand is a vibrant and playful typeface that is designed for both Latin and Gujarati writing systems. Commissioned by Google Fonts in June 2015 Shrikhand's visual punch and care-free attitude was inspired by the colourful, fun and inventive hand-painted street lettering that can be found all over the state of Gujarat. The designer, Jonny Pinhorn (formerly a type designer at Indian Type Foundry), spent three years living and working in Ahmedabad during which time he absorbed as much of the visual culture as possible.</p>
  <p>Shrikhand is the name of a creamy Indian sweet dish from where the font borrows its soft bulging curves and smooth texture. High contrast stroke junctions and tight spacing means Shrikhand’s fully potential is applied best in big colourful and flamboyant settings. Shrikhand can add oomph to any design across multiple platforms; blog banners, logotypes, children’s clothing or food labels. Shrikhand is a big, bold, unapologetic phataka, fully Unicode complaint and supported by Opentype technology. And it's free!! Go get some.</p>
  <p>The project files and documentation are shared on <a href="https://github.com/jonpinhorn/shrikhand">GitHub</a>. Shrikhand will soon be published by <a href="http://google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a>.</p>
